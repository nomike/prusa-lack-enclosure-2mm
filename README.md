A remix of the Prusa Lack Enclosure which uses 2 mm thick acrylic sheets instead of 3 mm. It optionally also supports having the PSU cables exit to the right instead of to the back.

Only modified objects are included in this repository.
You will also need some of [the original files](https://www.printables.com/model/17-original-prusa-i3-mk3-enclosure-ikea-lack-table-pr/files) from the Prusa Lack Enclosure.

It also features an enhanced redesign of the door stop and handles, which allow to specify the size of the magnets you have available. The magnets are also hidden inside the prints and can slide in to and out from the finished print easily.

#### Assembly Instructions

You can find the [original instructions](https://blog.prusa3d.com/cheap-simple-3d-printer-enclosure_7785/) on the prusa blog.
